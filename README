This is a Pac-man like game. It used java StdDraw and TETILE Engine provided by UCB.
This is the first version of my first game, and there will be new functions and bug-fix coming.

To start the game, open the whole folder as a java project,go to game Core file and click on Game,and then run that javafile to start the game.
